<p>The Quran (/kɔːrˈɑːn/[a] kor-AHN; Arabic: القرآن‎ al-Qurʾān,[b] literally meaning "the recitation"; also romanized Qur'an or Koran[c]) is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (Allah).[1] It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature.[2][3][4][5] The Quran is divided into chapters (surah in Arabic), which are then divided into verses (ayah).
Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel (Jibril),[6][7] gradually over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning on 22 December 609 CE,[8] when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632, the year of his death.[1][9][10] Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad, a proof of his prophethood,[11] and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam and ended with Muhammad. The word "Quran" occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran, although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran.[12]
According to the traditional narrative, several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations.[13] Shortly after Muhammad's death, the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it.[14] These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman's codex, which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today.]</p>

<p> There are, however, variant readings, with mostly minor differences in meaning.[13]
The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures. It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events.[15][16][17] The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance for mankind 2:185. It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.[18][19] The Quran is used along with authentic and reliable hadith to interpret sharia law.[20] During prayers, the Quran is recited only in Arabic.[21]</p>
Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz. Quranic verse (ayah) is sometimes recited with a special kind of elocution reserved for this purpose, called tajwid. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers. In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse, most Muslims rely on exegesis, or tafsir.[22
<p>Etymology and meaning
  The word qurʼān appears about 70 times in the Quran itself, assuming various meanings. 
  It is a verbal noun (maṣdar) of the Arabic verb qaraʼa (قرأ), meaning "he read" or "he recited". 
  The Syriac equivalent is (ܩܪܝܢܐ) qeryānā, which refers to "scripture reading" or "lesson".[23] 
  While some Western scholars consider the word to be derived from the Syriac, the majority of Muslim authorities hold the origin of the word is qaraʼa itself.[1]
 Regardless, it had become an Arabic term by Muhammad's lifetime.[1] 
 </p>
 <h5 >Page No 3</h5>

  <p> An important meaning of the word is the "act of reciting", as reflected in an early Quranic passage: "It is for Us to collect it and to recite it (qurʼānahu)."[24]
In other verses, the word refers to "an individual passage recited [by Muhammad]". Its liturgical context is seen in a number of passages, for example: "So when al-qurʼān is recited, listen to it and keep silent."[25] The word may also assume the meaning of a codified scripture when mentioned with other scriptures such as the Torah and Gospel.[26]
The term also has closely related synonyms that are employed throughout the Quran. Each synonym possesses its own distinct meaning, but its use may converge with that of qurʼān in certain contexts. Such terms include kitāb (book); āyah (sign); and sūrah (scripture). The latter two terms also denote units of revelation. In the large majority of contexts, usually with a definite article (al-), the word is referred to as the "revelation" (waḥy), that which has been "sent down" (tanzīl) at intervals.[27][28] Other related words are: dhikr (remembrance), used to refer to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning, and ḥikmah (wisdom), sometimes referring to the revelation or part of it.[1][29]
The Quran describes itself as "the discernment" (al-furqān), "the mother book" (umm al-kitāb), "the guide" (huda), "the wisdom" (hikmah), "the remembrance" (dhikr) and "the revelation" (tanzīl; something sent down, signifying the descent of an object from a higher place to lower place).[30] Another term is al-kitāb (The Book), though it is also used in the Arabic language for other scriptures, such as the Torah and the Gospels. The term mus'haf ('written work') is often used to refer to particular Quranic manuscripts but is also used in the Quran to identify earlier revealed books.[1]</p>

The Prophet of Islam, from the aspect of ethics was the most eminent of men and a perfect human being. 
He possessed all good qualities to perfection and was pure of all evils and bad manners. 
The criteria of morals, which are mentioned in Islam and Quran, were personified in the being of His Eminence as Ayesha,
 his wife and other companions have also admitted.
Abu Darda says: I asked Ayesha about the morals and manners of the Holy Prophet (S). 
She said: The morals of the Prophet were based on Quran. He was pleased with whatever 
Almighty Allah was pleased with and was angry at whatever Almighty Allah was angry with.1
He was having such excellent morals that Quran has praised him and said with regard to him:

<p>
Although in this short treatise it is not possible to explain all the great manners and morals of the Messenger of Allah (S), we would try to mention some of them here:

Amirul Momineen (a.s.) in the description of the Holy Prophet (S) says:

In generosity, he was ahead of all the people. He was the bravest of all. He was most truthful, loyal and had a kind disposition. 
He was the most social person. Whoever encountered him initially was influenced by his awe and after meeting him and being in his company used become fond of him. 
I have neither seen anyone like His Eminence before or after that.2
Anas ibn Malik has said with regard to His Eminence: He had the most excellent manners, was most forbearing and generous of the people. 
It never happened that they asked something from him and he refused.3

Ayesha says: The Holy Prophet (S) was not bad mannered lacking morals and he was not of those who raised a hue and cry in the markets.
 He did not recompense a bad deed with a bad turn; on the contrary he always forgave mistakes.4

Husain ibn Ali (a.s.) has narrated from his father that he said:

The Holy Prophet (S) was always cheerful, good natured and soft spoken; he was never nasty, bad natured and fault-picker and he ignored that which he did not like. 
He never disappointed anyone. He had purified his self from three things: Argumentation, extravagance and vain acts. 
In three things he had nothing to do with anyone: He was never harsh and a fault finder; he was never inclined to expose the secrets and hidden deficiencies of others; he never spoke, except when it entailed gaining heavenly rewards

Anas ibn Malik says: I went to the Holy Prophet (S) to find him wearing a dress with a coarse edge. 
A Bedouin came to His Eminence, held his garment and pulled it roughly in such a way that 
I saw its signs on his shoulder; then he said: Muhammad, give me some of Allah’s wealth. 
The Holy Prophet (S) looked at him and smiled; then he ordered his men to give something to that man.
6The Prophet of Islam (S) diligently observed the manners of society. He was extremely humble and kind. He treated all Muslims equally, respected all and expressed his love for them. He asked the well-being of those who were absent and visited the sick. He was present in funeral ceremonies. He accorded respect to children and greeted them first.
Abu Qatada has said with regard to His Eminence. Despite that grade and status, his humility exceeded that of other people.
When he came to a group of companions, they stood up to pay respect to him, but he said: Do not honor me like the Persians who stand to pay respect to each other. I am the servant of God and I eat and drink like them. The Holy Prophet (S) sometimes used to be astride a donkey and also made another person sit behind him. He visited the poor to show his support and interacted with the underprivileged and even accepted invitations of slaves. When he entered an assembly, he took a seat in the last row.7
Jarir says with regard to the Messenger of Allah (S): He joked and spoke jovially with his friends. 
He also played with children and seated them in his lap. He accepted the invitation of all; visited the sick in the farthest corner of the city;
 accepted the excuse of those who committed mistakes.8
 <h5 >Page No 7</h5>

Anas says: The Holy Prophet (S) never stretched his legs before others.
 He saluted first whenever he met someone. He shook hands with his friends. 
 He never stretched his legs before his companions. He accorded respect to all who came to meet him.
  Sometimes he used to spread out his cloak for the visitor to sit on or gave him that on which he was himself sitting. 
  He addressed his companions with their agnomen (Kunyah) and called them with the best of names. He never interrupted when others spoke.9

Ibn Masud says: A person wanted to speak to the Holy Prophet (S), but began to tremble at the awe of His Eminence.
 The Prophet said: Take it easy. I am not a king. Rather, I am the son of a lady who ate dried meat.10

Abu Dharr says: The Messenger of Allah (S) was seated among the companions when a poor man entered the assembly; 
but he could not recognize the Holy Prophet (S) without asking who the Prophet was.11
Anas says: The Messenger of Allah (S) passed by some children and greeted them.
He also says: When the Holy Prophet (S) did not see one of the companions for three days, he inquired about his well-being. 
If he were on a journey, he used to pray for him and if he was in town he used to go and meet him; if he was sick he paid a visit to him.12
Ayesha says: The Holy Prophet (S) never beat up his servants and he never hit anyone except in Holy war (Jihad).13
Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.) said: The Messenger of Allah (S) distributed his attention equally to all his companions and looked at them for equal 
duration of time.14
As a result of the good morals and manners of the Holy Prophet (S) people were attracted to him and accepted his call as the Quran has said:
